        <h1>MSP432 Microcontroller Project: Sequencer</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio website showcasing my final project, a sequencer. The sequencer allows you to trigger notes using buttons and switches, with the option to adjust the 
            tempo using a potentiometer. The project utilizes timers and interrupts to generate sound and provide interactive
            functionality. It uses the MSP432 microcontroller. </p>
            <br>
        <p>The sequencer project includes the following features and functionalities:</p>

        <li>Port Functions: Initialize and manage project ports (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P7).</li>
            <br>   
        <li>Timer Functions: Handle timing and sound generation with Timer A0, A1, and A2.</li>
            <br> 
        <li>Interrupt Functions: Configure button and switch interrupts for the sequencer.</li>
            <br> 
        <li>ADC Functions: Read input values from a potentiometer using ADC initialization.</li>
            <br> 
        <li>Speaker Functions: Control the speaker and play notes.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p>To the right is a final demonstration of the project. →</p>

    <h1>Original Concept Description:</h1>
        <br>
    <p>The project incorporated the following ideas:</p>

    <li>Button-controlled Notes: This will allow users to turn on and off specific musical notes using buttons. Each 
        button corresponded to a different note, providing a customizable and interactive playing experience.</li>
        <br>   
    <li>Pitch Control: A potentiometer will be utilized to adjust the pitch of the notes. By turning the potentiometer, users could 
        modulate the frequency of the played notes, allowing for expressive and dynamic performances.</li>
        <br> 
    <li>Tempo Control: Another potentiometer will be used to control the tempo of the music. Users could increase or 
        decrease the tempo, influencing the speed at which the notes were played.</li>
        <br> 
    <li>RGB LED Feedback: To enhance the visual aspect of the instrument, we will integrat RGB LEDs that will display
        different colors to represent the state of each note. The LEDs illuminated in distinct colors to indicate whether a note is on 
        or off.</li>
        <br> 
    <li>Speaker Playback: The speaker will play the corresponding notes by running through the sequence. Running through 
        the sequence will also light up the LEDs of the note being played.</li>
        <br> 
    <p>The original concept of this project was to design a sequencer using the MSP432 microcontroller. It aimed to combine 
        interactive controls, visual feedback, and musical expression, creating a unique and engaging experience.</p>

<div class="text-section">
    <h1>Problems Encountered:</h1>

    <p>LED Sequencing:</p>
    <li>Incorrect LED sequence: The LEDs were not going through the sequence correctly, blinking irregularly instead of 
        following the desired pattern.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Dim LEDs: Initially, the LEDs were not bright enough, and replacing the resistors with lower ohm ones was necessary 
        to achieve the desired brightness.</li>

    <p>Push Button Functionality:</p>
    <li>Incorrect button activation: The push buttons were not activating the intended array due to setting them for active high 
        instead of active low. This issue was related to how the interrupts were coded.</li>

    <p>State Machine and On/Off Button:</p>
    <li>State setting issue: Difficulties were encountered in correctly setting the state in the state machine when working on 
        the on/off button functionality. The code was not properly updating the state, affecting the expected behavior.</li>

    <p>These obstacles highlight the challenges faced in implementing the LED sequencing, LED brightness, configuring the 
        push buttons for the correct activation, and ensuring the proper functioning of the state machine related to the on/off 
        button.</p>

    <div class="text-section">
        <h1>Possible Improvements With More Time:</h1>
        <p>One possible improvement that could have been made to the project is to incorporate additional LEDs for visualizing the 
            active notes. This would provide a clearer representation of the notes that are currently playing, enhancing the overall 
            user experience.
            <br>
        <p>Another improvement could have been to integrate a potentiometer for adjusting the pitch of the notes. This would allow 
            users to customize the musical output and explore different melodies or harmonies, adding more versatility to the 
            instrument.
            <br>
        <p>By implementing these enhancements, the project would have offered a more engaging and interactive musical 
            experience, providing users with more control over their compositions.</p>
